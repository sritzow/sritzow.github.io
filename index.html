		<h5>The First Day</h5>
		<p>Today I learned about twitter bots written in python. How they intereact with the twitter API using the access keys and what you are able to retrieve from it. Also sending tweets out as well as responding to trending topic tweets. I also learned about setting up a github repository as well as commiting, pushing and pulling from the repository while working with a group. With this you can easily control the source files in a project with the ability to see what has changed from each push in every file.</p>

		<h5>Breaking into booleans</h5>
		<p>Today we talked about boolean logic. This includes comparing booleans where they are true, false and also including multiple booleans using OR and AND statements. We worked on a project about a dice rolling game. Two players played a dice game, best of 3. Who ever got two wins first won. If a player rolled a one, they automatically won, but if someone rolled a 2, they got a win taken away from them. If when someone reached 2 wins, the other player had -1 wins, they person with -1 wins automatically won the game. There were 6 different dice to choose from and each time you picked one, it was taken from the list of useable dice. We also disscussed String formating. with this you can make full strings upper or lowercase, as well as replacing or removing characters or words in a string. This also is helpful for printing lines much easier.</p>

		<h5>On your own</h5>
		<p>Today we worked some more on projects from yesterday that were incomplete. As I had mine finished, I worked on creating the game of life. In the game of life, you have a grid of "people". Each time the "day" changes, everyone must be evaluated. If someone has less than 2 neighbors, they die due to under population. If they have 3 or 4 neighbors, they continue to live. If they have more than 4 neighbors they die due to overpopulation. If a place with no living person has 3 neighbors, someone appears there due to repopulation next day. This continues until there is no more living people. I was struggling for a bit with checking for death and repopulation for awhile, until I realized python copies variables by reference unless specified. Because of this I was getting undesired results until I fixed it.</p>

		<h5>On your own</h5>
		<p>In class today, we worked on talking about loops, and functions. Loops are idea for shortening tasks that must be completed multiple times in a row with the same data. If we need to print out something 5 times we can make a loop that will run 5 times to complete the task with much less code. Functions are also ideal for shortening code. If we will be doing the same action many times in a program, we can make a function to call that code whenever we happen to need it. This is useful because we don't need to re-write the same thing multiple times. We went back and edited our dice program to include functions and loops to improve the efficiency of the code.</p>
