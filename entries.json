{"date":"04/13/2015", "title":"The First Day", "text":"Today I learned about twitter bots written in python. How they intereact with the twitter API using the access keys and what you are able to retrieve from it. Also sending tweets out as well as responding to trending topic tweets. I also learned about setting up a github repository as well as commiting, pushing and pulling from the repository while working with a group. With this you can easily control the source files in a project with the ability to see what has changed from each push in every file."},
{"date":"04/14/2015", "title":"Breaking into booleans", "text":"Today we talked about boolean logic. This includes comparing booleans where they are true, false and also including multiple booleans using OR and AND statements. We worked on a project about a dice rolling game. Two players played a dice game, best of 3. Who ever got two wins first won. If a player rolled a one, they automatically won, but if someone rolled a 2, they got a win taken away from them. If when someone reached 2 wins, the other player had -1 wins, they person with -1 wins automatically won the game. There were 6 different dice to choose from and each time you picked one, it was taken from the list of useable dice. We also disscussed String formating. with this you can make full strings upper or lowercase, as well as replacing or removing characters or words in a string. This also is helpful for printing lines much easier."},
{"date":"04/15/2015", "title":"On your own", "text":"Today we worked some more on projects from yesterday that were incomplete. As I had mine finished, I worked on creating the game of life. In the game of life, you have a grid of \"people\". Each time the \"day\" changes, everyone must be evaluated. If someone has less than 2 neighbors, they die due to under population. If they have 3 or 4 neighbors, they continue to live. If they have more than 4 neighbors they die due to overpopulation. If a place with no living person has 3 neighbors, someone appears there due to repopulation next day. This continues until there is no more living people. I was struggling for a bit with checking for death and repopulation for awhile, until I realized python copies variables by reference unless specified. Because of this I was getting undesired results until I fixed it."},
{"date":"04/16/2015", "title":"Loop de loop", "text":"In class today, we worked on talking about loops, and functions. Loops are idea for shortening tasks that must be completed multiple times in a row with the same data. If we need to print out something 5 times we can make a loop that will run 5 times to complete the task with much less code. Functions are also ideal for shortening code. If we will be doing the same action many times in a program, we can make a function to call that code whenever we happen to need it. This is useful because we don't need to re-write the same thing multiple times. We went back and edited our dice program to include functions and loops to improve the efficiency of the code."},
{"date":"04/17/2015", "title":"Try again", "text":"Try and catches were one of the topics we discussed in class today. With these you are able to run pieces of code that may return an error at one point, such as getting user inputs. If you are trying to turn a users input into an int, you should use a try catch as if they enter a letter or other character, you will get a runtime error. By using the try, we can make sure we are receiving a valid input while converting it to the new type. This is useful for things such as file io, int conversion from strings, as well as many other uses due to the fact that they save the program from crashing."},
{"date":"04/20/2015", "title":"Group together", "text":"Today we started working on a personal project and a group project. Our group project is a twitter streamer that will collect lots of data from specific areas and store it in a mongoDB. With this we will analyze it for common words, tags based on each area. After we analyse the data, we will display it on a website for everyone to see. My personal project is going to be a 2d minecraft game. You will be able to walk around, destroy and build bricks in a 2d environment. This will pose many challenges such as physics, basic ai for enemies as well as map generation. For the first day, I have started with map drawing and simple map generation. Once these are working, I can then move onto physics with the player."},
{"date":"04/21/2015", "title":"Code Reviews", "text":"Today I did a code review on everyones code for the twitter streaming project. I mashed everything together and got it working as intended. I met up with everyone and explained the entire program and answered questions on each part as we went. A few things had to be changed in order to incorporate everyones task, but now it is working. After, I ran it for a while in order to test and gather some tweets. Towards the end of the day, it had gathered around 68,000 tweets. After, I worked on my personal project, doing tests with static and dynamic bodies in order to get a player able to move in the game."},
{"date":"04/22/2015", "title":"It's personal", "text":"Class was spent mostly working on our personal and group projects today. Half way through we talked about improving our image for future job searching. We googled our names and worked on creating a good looking linkedin page. We talked about why these are useful tools when looking for a job as employers often look at these. After that we continued working on our projects. I was able to get moving and jumping finished on my 2d game along with destroying and creating blocks. When you destroy blocks you receive them in your inventory and when you place them you lose them from your inventory. Next I will need to work on displaying your inventory on screen and adding some more features."},
{"date":"04/23/2015", "title":"Grind it out", "text":"Today was a busy day. Everyone had questions about the project we were working on and I did my best to explain what needed to be done. After much discussion we were able to get through all the tasks at hand. Now it is up to me to take all the analysed data and create graphs to represent the data. I found a nice library called pygal that takes data and creates many different types of graphs to represent it. I had some trouble with loading the data back in from the database due to the data not getting structured as I thought it would and mongodb throwing in a random object into the list. I wasn't able to get any work on my personal project, but I am at a point were it would be fine to show off."},
{"date":"04/24/2015", "title":"Final Stretch", "text":"Today was the final stretch for our projects. We presented our personal projects in the middle of the class and explained what we did and how we utilized different libraries to get our task done. After that we finished working on our twitter analyser and I worked on creating graphs from the data we had. After I generated the graphs, I created a HTML page to host all the graphs on my GitHub. Pygal made the graph generation extremely easy and I was able to make alot of graphs to represent all of our data. We also had a small decryption project towards the end as a little end of the week challenge."},
{"date":"04/27/2015", "title":"Pitch day", "text":"Today was pitch day, we were to think up a feature that would be useful within our personal project that hasn't been added yet and pitch the idea along with reasons why it would be worth the time invested in it as if we were a company. I had decided that random terrain would be beneficial as my game is about exploring. We also had some time to work on our projects, and I added in doors and ladders to my project. We then had a pressure challenge to code a program within a certain amount of time. I was able to do it in just under 20 minutes then started to work on an irc bot for fun. The goal of the IRC bot is to be able to place dice games against other people."},
{"date":"04/28/2015", "title":"Ze End", "text":"Today was the last day of our python section. We presented our finalized personal projects and had a mock technical interview. My personal project was looking good with my newly added images and features to bring it to a nice working game. In the mock interview we were asked a few questions about python and then were given a marker board challenge. The challenge is called the Fizz Buzz challenge. If a number is divisible by 3, print fizz, if it is divisible by 5, print buzz, if it is divisible by both, print fizz buzz. After that, we discussed on what our opinions were about the course so far and what we were expecting coming into the class. This ends our 2 weeks of python, and onwards to javascript."},
{"date":"04/29/2015", "title":"Start Anew", "text":"We are starting anew today, and are heading into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We were tasked to work on 3 labs today that dealt with getting used to HTML and CSS. The first lab was an introduction to HTML, showing how sections, divs and paragraphs effect a HTML page. The second one was to change the page from the last lab to make it match as close as possible to an image provided to us. We had to use styling to make changes such as borders, text color, and font weight. After that we needed to edit a blog template and fill out our information to use as a starter blog that we will end up working on later. After that I did some research about jQuery and what you can do with it as I use it a little bit in one of my personal projects. After getting some info I went on testing to see what worked and didn't work with what I had found."},
{"date":"04/30/2015", "title":"JS Intro", "text":"Today was our start of JavaScript and jQuery. We had a good amount of small labs to do to quickly learn JavaScript. We covered if statements, case statements, while and for loops, as well as arrays and objects. JavaScript has a lot different syntax than Python such as the use of Parenthesis in if/while/for statements, as well as the use of curly braces and semicolons. After I finished up with the labs, I did research on content management systems such as Drupal and Wordpress. I also looked into the limitations of github pages. Later on I looked into AJAX for loading content after the page has been refreshed to fill HTML dynamically. This will be very useful in personal projects of mine that rely heavily on dynamic data that changes alot."},
{"date":"05/1/2015", "title":"Challenge Problems", "text":"Challenge problems were the topic of the day. We had a few using multidimensional arrays were we needed to print specific indexs from those array in a special order. As the arrays were multidimensional we needed multiple indexes to access the things we needed to print out. After this I worked on recoding some PHP for one of my personal websites. I am using MySQL to store data and I am using an object oriented approach to how I handle it. This will take a bit to get all the parts to work together, but it will make adding changes and getting data logs much easier with this sort of structure."},
{"date":"05/4/2015", "title":"A New Challenge", "text":"Today we had a few labs to work on. They dealt with JavaScript functions and form handling. After those we moved into using jQuery in the same labs to see the differences between. Next we did form validation with using jQuery and auto updating when values are entered. The auto updating was calculation ideal values based on one of the entered field. I started on a personal project then which at first will be a WPM calculator, then will evolve into being collaborative programming. This is pose many problems that will need to be solved and should be alot of fun."},
{"date":"05/5/2015", "title":"Getting Started", "text":"Today I started working on my solo projects. I finished the WPM calculating program and gave it a nice looking style. After that I worked on creating a bootstrap based website to hold all the projects I will be creating. Using bootstrap makes it extremely easy to add onto the website and gives me lots of flexibility. Next I started to work on a syntax highlighter. I started off using a hidden textarea and displaying everything in a div right on top of that box, but it ended up posing multiple issues so I decided to go looking for an already existing project. I found CodeMirror and Ace. CodeMirror was nice, but it didn't offer much functionality that I was able to find. Ace is used by lots of places such as github and has all the functionality that I am looking for. Now that I have found that, I am going to be moving on to making collaborative programming. I am planning on using Socket IO to send broadcast messages to the users and will see how that goes."},
{"date":"05/6/2015", "title":"About me", "text":"I have been programming for a good 5 years. I started out working at Target as a Cashier and moved my way up to Customer Service. Shortly after starting there, I got an unpaid internship working at Everfire Studios. While I was there I worked on leading a small team of programmers to create video games. I stay there for alittle over one year before departing from them. At the same time, I was going to school at MATC for computer programming. As I have had previous experience with programming and do it on my free time as well, I became uninterested in school due to the simplicity of classes. After I stopped attending school, I moved onto doing some free lance web development creating two websites. I created on personal website for a game that I had been interested in, as well as one for a friend who had similar interests. I was still liking programming, and decided I should do something about it so I decided to start looking for to go to school again. I found devCodeCamp and have been attending it for four weeks. While I have been here I have worked on many projects. I started with making small edits to an existing Twitter bot. This was to get familiar with Python and progress throughout the program. After that I started making a simple dice rolling game between two players. Once complete, I was tasked with a personal project and a team project. I was the leader in the team project and gave tasks to the team members for the project. We used an agile system to assign and work on the tasks for the single sprint we ended up doing. My personal project was 2D platforming game that utilized mechanics such as block destroying and placing, door opening and ladder climbing to create a world. I have now moved onto learning JavaScript and jQuery. I have created a blog using bootstrap that loads the blog entries via JSON as well as hosting my contact information. In the class we have also had coding challenges, such as trying to make code that is not readable to show why it is necessary to make code readable for other coders. As I am much more experienced then the other people in class, I am working on a side project that will utilized socket io and node.js in order to create a collaborative coding platform. This poses multiple challenges such as networking and multiple users editing the same thing. I hope to work on more team projects going forward to further my experience in working in a team setting, as well as adding some more personal projects under my belt."},
{"date":"05/7/2015", "title":"Collaboration", "text":"Today I worked on my collaborative coding project quite a bit. I have gotten it to were multiple users can code inside of a single document and will receive updates when other users type. They will also receive the most up to date information when connecting to the room. This will save the data to a MySQL database every so often to prevent lost work. I also added the ability to have multiple different documents that users can connect to and use separately that will not share data between them. Towards the end of the day, I decided to add the ability to run JavaScript that is entered into the page to be ran right away for testing. This allows users to test their code while still in the browser. I also worked a little bit on finishing up my blog. I added the ability to search through my posts along with highlighting the searched word in the posts results. I added some fadeIn and fadeOut functions to make the disappearing data on the page look good while going in and out. I had time left to spare, so I looked into Phaser which is a JavaScript game engine. I was able to create a game with physics and block destroying just like what I did with python. There are some functions that differ and do not work how I would like them to, so I would have to do some work around to get block adding into the game. It was a fun experience to see what built in functions they already had in there that make game development much easier."},
{"date":"05/8/2015", "title":"Lets collaborate!", "text":"Today I worked exclusively on my collaboration project. I started the day off by changing the structure of my server sided code a little bit to handle some new features. I added in private and public documents. Users need to be authorized to access private documents and need no access to see a public document. I also added access levels, so documents can require certain levels for certain actions. If they set the requirement of access level 1 for editting, a user will not be able to edit the document at all, but will receive any updates to it. After I finished getting that working, I added functionality to remove a user from the document mid session if their rights are revoked. Once that was complete, I started working on automatic back-ups for the documents. While the users are typing, each document will have a sync value, which determines every how many edits the document is uploaded to the database. The document will back up the last sync every x amount of times it syncs to the database. Automatic backups are a per document basis, so this can be disabled so the document will only have the current document. Each account also has a limit on how many projects they can make and whether or not they can make projects private. I still have a bunch I would like to do and hope to get some more work done next week."},
{"date":"05/11/2015", "title":"Blog Review", "text":"Today I had my blog review. I needed to present my blog as if I was presenting to someone from HR and explain what technologies I used and why I used them. It needed to be non technical so someone that doesn't do programming could understand it. Then I had to present as if I was presenting to programmers and explain why and how my methods worked and why I chose to do it how I did. After this we had a little info session on SQL. We discussed inner and left joins as well as simple select statements. After that, we had some time to work on our projects. I started to make a login and register page using bootstrap and jQuery validation. For some reason I got stuck for a bit on the validation because it wasn't going off due to some error that wasn't displayed to me. After I figured that out, I got registration and logging in working. We had a discussion on how everyone did their construction project and wrote it out on a white board. This took awhile as there were some people that hadn't finished the project yet but we got through it in the end."},
{"date":"05/12/2015", "title":"Folders N Files", "text":"Today was pretty much solely directed at folder and file creation for projects. Users can now create files and folders inside of their projects. I still have some work to do to make it fully functional, such as adding file extensions so there is a difference between code files. With this, the editor will know what syntax to use when someone is coding. I also added the ability to switch between files. You can open a file, then open another one to switch directly over to the other file. This is working how I would like it to and am very happy about it. I still have quite a bit of work to do, but nothing that isn't unaccomplishable. Tomorrow will be a good day as I have a good start for the file system and some tweaks will make it nice and pretty. I used the beginning of the day to find and get a plugin working to show multiple lists for the file structure. I used recursion to get the folders and files from the database and display them on the website."},
{"date":"05/13/2015", "title":"Project Manager", "text":"Today I worked on getting project management working. This was quite the task as there is a lot to go into it. There is now options to see all your projects, as well as to edit the project. In the edit section, you are able to edit the name of the project, the description of the project, add and remove users that can see your project as well as edit which users can edit files in your project. This took quite a bit of work as there is multiple php files that goes into it. I also uploaded all my files to a server so I am able to test it with other people when I get the chance. I started working on adding the ability to delete files and folders from your project. I will only allow folders to be deleted if it has no children. Once I get this working, I have a few more steps to go such as project searching, accounts settings, and general debugging then I will be happy with where I am at."},
{"date":"05/14/2015", "title":"Finishing up", "text":"Today I worked on adding a few features to my project. Firstly I added the ability to create different file extensions. This makes it able to have code highlighting based on what file you have open. After that I moved on to adding password changing in the account settings. I fixed a few things regarding file permissions for file deleting and added the ability to follow projects. If you follow a project, it will show up in your projects. I touched up the project settings and did some testing with a few people on the document at the same time. After that, I looked around on stackoverflow and helped answer some questions. I have a little touching up to do, then I will be at a good position with my project."},
{"date":"05/15/2015", "title":"The End..", "text":"Today was the last official day to work on our projects. I was extremely happy were I was at and took a break today. I did some minor fixes and updates to the website as well as created a project that no one can edit on my website that holds all the code to the site. After this, I took a nice and easy day. Browsing the web and working a little on a personal project of mine. We had a little review about what we would be doing on Monday and then everyone got back to work. I answered a few questions on stackoverflow as I am content where my project has come."},
{"date":"05/18/2015", "title":"The Start of C#", "text":"Today is the start of our C# section. We started the day by having a javascript test and presenting our personal projects to the class. After this was done, we had a couple lectures going over some fairly basic C# things, such as setting up console, windows forms, WPF, and ASP.NET applications. We went over how to compile using the command line, as well as using Visual Studios. We didn't go over much in syntax today, but will be doing more in the future."},
{"date":"05/19/2015", "title":"See more C#", "text":"Today we had a small lecture on some general IT related topics. We went over PKI and how networks are set up. We had some discussion on IP addresses as well as MAC addresses. I knew a bit about these things so it wasn't anything over the top. After that we dove into some C# with a few labs. They were easy ones to get the ball rolling with that. After that we went over creating a small program that monitors file changes and copies the files that change from a folder we are monitoring to a new destination. After that, I worked with Unity3d for awhile, exploring around creating a MMO networking system that utilizes packets."},
{"date":"05/20/2015", "title":"Getting into it", "text":"Today we started to get into C# a little more. We started going over if statements, for/foreach/while loops, switch statements as well as a few other things. After finishing up the first couple labs, we did some career development and worked on our resumes. We went over about creating a professional summary and what should be included in there. After that we had a small lecture about IP Addresses and how they work."},
{"date":"05/21/2015", "title":"Functions and Coding Challenge", "text":"Today we started to learn about functions and what you can do with them. Some examples would be overloading, passing by ref or using out to return multiple variables. In our coding challenge, we needed to make it so a computer could guess a number 1-5000 that we enter in using a binary sort. I also took the liberty to use threads to make a few different variations to try to get the quickest time. Some examples of this would be fully random guessing, random for the first or second guess, start at the bottom or top as well as a few others. I quickly finished up some labs towards the end to end the day off."},
{"date":"05/22/2015", "title":"Classes", "text":"Today we learned about functions, methods and classes and how they work together. After the lecture, we had a couple labs to work on to get used to using classes and functions. We learned about the differences between private and public methods and variables as well as a little intro to inheritance. After these we had a small coding challenge to determine weather a string is a palindrome or not without using any libraries. I worked abit with Unity in my spare time and started to work with state machines and player controllers."},
{"date":"05/26/2015", "title":"Presentation Prep", "text":"Today we went over presenting our presentations to the class in order to prep us for our group presentation tomorrow. After going over the presentations we also had the task to present one other persons project so they were able to get another view at how their project could be presented. This gave me a few more ideas that I could incorporate into my presentation that I will do tomorrow. We also had a few labs that we needed to do in the beginning of the day working with classes and arrays. I worked these out quickly then worked a bit on my side project. I was working with migrating a client between two servers to transfer between a world server and a game server. "},
{"date":"05/27/2015", "title":"The Meetup", "text":"Today we worked a little bit on doing some quality assurance with our Javascript projects. As today we were having a meetup where people can come and check them out we needed to make sure there wasn't any unknown bugs in the programs. After going though them and fixing them up we had a few labs to work on and finished those up really quick. Later in the day we had the meet up. There was 4 other people there and we all did our presentations. After the presentations, everyone broke up and started talking about the projects or what everyone does. There was one person that seemed very interested in programming and is looking to join in on the next class run."},
{"date":"06/9/2015", "title":"Selecting SQL", "text":"Today we starting talking about SQL and data driven development. We went over using SQL statements and how they are used to get data from a database. Using statements such as SELECT, WHERE, JOIN as well as some others in order to get and manipulate data within a database. This is very useful once you are starting to work with alot of data for users that has to be stored somewhere as databases can be very quick for getting and storing data."}
