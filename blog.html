		<h5>The First Day</h5>
		<p>Today I learned about twitter bots written in python. How they intereact with the twitter API using the access keys and what you are able to retrieve from it. Also sending tweets out as well as responding to trending topic tweets. I also learned about setting up a github repository as well as commiting, pushing and pulling from the repository while working with a group. With this you can easily control the source files in a project with the ability to see what has changed from each push in every file.</p>

		<h5>Breaking into booleans</h5>
		<p>Today we talked about boolean logic. This includes comparing booleans where they are true, false and also including multiple booleans using OR and AND statements. We worked on a project about a dice rolling game. Two players played a dice game, best of 3. Who ever got two wins first won. If a player rolled a one, they automatically won, but if someone rolled a 2, they got a win taken away from them. If when someone reached 2 wins, the other player had -1 wins, they person with -1 wins automatically won the game. There were 6 different dice to choose from and each time you picked one, it was taken from the list of useable dice. We also disscussed String formating. with this you can make full strings upper or lowercase, as well as replacing or removing characters or words in a string. This also is helpful for printing lines much easier.</p>

		<h5>On your own</h5>
		<p>Today we worked some more on projects from yesterday that were incomplete. As I had mine finished, I worked on creating the game of life. In the game of life, you have a grid of "people". Each time the "day" changes, everyone must be evaluated. If someone has less than 2 neighbors, they die due to under population. If they have 3 or 4 neighbors, they continue to live. If they have more than 4 neighbors they die due to overpopulation. If a place with no living person has 3 neighbors, someone appears there due to repopulation next day. This continues until there is no more living people. I was struggling for a bit with checking for death and repopulation for awhile, until I realized python copies variables by reference unless specified. Because of this I was getting undesired results until I fixed it.</p>

		<h5>Loop de loop</h5>
		<p>In class today, we worked on talking about loops, and functions. Loops are idea for shortening tasks that must be completed multiple times in a row with the same data. If we need to print out something 5 times we can make a loop that will run 5 times to complete the task with much less code. Functions are also ideal for shortening code. If we will be doing the same action many times in a program, we can make a function to call that code whenever we happen to need it. This is useful because we don't need to re-write the same thing multiple times. We went back and edited our dice program to include functions and loops to improve the efficiency of the code.</p>

		<h5>Try again</h5>
		<p>Try and catches were one of the topics we discussed in class today. With these you are able to run pieces of code that may return an error at one point, such as getting user inputs. If you are trying to turn a users input into an int, you should use a try catch as if they enter a letter or other character, you will get a runtime error. By using the try, we can make sure we are receiving a valid input while converting it to the new type. This is useful for things such as file io, int conversion from strings, as well as many other uses due to the fact that they save the program from crashing.</p>

		<h5>Group together</h5>
		<p>Today we started working on a personal project and a group project. Our group project is a twitter streamer that will collect lots of data from specific areas and store it in a mongoDB. With this we will analyze it for common words, tags based on each area. After we analyse the data, we will display it on a website for everyone to see. My personal project is going to be a 2d minecraft game. You will be able to walk around, destroy and build bricks in a 2d environment. This will pose many challenges such as physics, basic ai for enemies as well as map generation. For the first day, I have started with map drawing and simple map generation. Once these are working, I can then move onto physics with the player.</p>

		<h5>Code Reviews</h5>
		<p>Today I did a code review on everyones code for the twitter streaming project. I mashed everything together and got it working as intended. I met up with everyone and explained the entire program and answered questions on each part as we went. A few things had to be changed in order to incorporate everyones task, but now it is working. After, I ran it for a while in order to test and gather some tweets. Towards the end of the day, it had gathered around 68,000 tweets. After, I worked on my personal project, doing tests with static and dynamic bodies in order to get a player able to move in the game.</p>

		<h5>It's personal</h5>
		<p>Class was spent mostly working on our personal and group projects today. Half way through we talked about improving our image for future job searching. We googled our names and worked on creating a good looking linkedin page. We talked about why these are useful tools when looking for a job as employers often look at these. After that we continued working on our projects. I was able to get moving and jumping finished on my 2d game along with destroying and creating blocks. When you destroy blocks you receive them in your inventory and when you place them you lose them from your inventory. Next I will need to work on displaying your inventory on screen and adding some more features.</p>

		<h5>Grind it out</h5>
		<p>Today was a busy day. Everyone had questions about the project we were working on and I did my best to explain what needed to be done. After much discussion we were able to get through all the tasks at hand. Now it is up to me to take all the analysed data and create graphs to represent the data. I found a nice library called pygal that takes data and creates many different types of graphs to represent it. I had some trouble with loading the data back in from the database due to the data not getting structured as I thought it would and mongodb throwing in a random object into the list. I wasn't able to get any work on my personal project, but I am at a point were it would be fine to show off.</p>

		<h5>Final Stretch</h5>
		<p>Today was the final stretch for our projects. We presented our personal projects in the middle of the class and explained what we did and how we utilized different libraries to get our task done. After that we finished working on our twitter analyser and I worked on creating graphs from the data we had. After I generated the graphs, I created a HTML page to host all the graphs on my GitHub. Pygal made the graph generation extremely easy and I was able to make alot of graphs to represent all of our data. We also had a small decryption project towards the end as a little end of the week challenge.</p>

		<h5>Pitch day</h5>
		<p>Today was pitch day, we were to think up a feature that would be useful within our personal project that hasn't been added yet and pitch the idea along with reasons why it would be worth the time invested in it as if we were a company. I had decided that random terrain would be beneficial as my game is about exploring. We also had some time to work on our projects, and I added in doors and ladders to my project. We then had a pressure challenge to code a program within a certain amount of time. I was able to do it in just under 20 minutes then started to work on an irc bot for fun. The goal of the IRC bot is to be able to place dice games against other people.</p>

		<h5>Ze End</h5>
		<p>Today was the last day of our python section. We presented our finalized personal projects and had a mock technical interview. My personal project was looking good with my newly added images and features to bring it to a nice working game. In the mock interview we were asked a few questions about python and then were given a marker board challenge. The challenge is called the Fizz Buzz challenge. If a number is divisible by 3, print fizz, if it is divisible by 5, print buzz, if it is divisible by both, print fizz buzz. After that, we discussed on what our opinions were about the course so far and what we were expecting coming into the class. This ends our 2 weeks of python, and onwards to javascript.</p>

		<h5>Start Anew</h5>
		<p>We are starting anew today, and are heading into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We were tasked to work on 3 labs today that dealt with getting used to HTML and CSS. The first lab was an introduction to HTML, showing how sections, divs and paragraphs effect a HTML page. The second one was to change the page from the last lab to make it match as close as possible to an image provided to us. We had to use styling to make changes such as borders, text color, and font weight. After that we needed to edit a blog template and fill out our information to use as a starter blog that we will end up working on later. After that I did some research about jQuery and what you can do with it as I use it a little bit in one of my personal projects. After getting some info I went on testing to see what worked and didn't work with what I had found.</p>

		<h5>JS Intro</h5>
		<p>Today was our start of JavaScript and jQuery. We had a good amount of small labs to do to quickly learn JavaScript. We covered if statements, case statements, while and for loops, as well as arrays and objects. JavaScript has a lot different syntax than Python such as the use of Parenthesis in if/while/for statements, as well as the use of curly braces and semicolons. After I finished up with the labs, I did research on content management systems such as Drupal and Wordpress. I also looked into the limitations of github pages. Later on I looked into AJAX for loading content after the page has been refreshed to fill HTML dynamically. This will be very useful in personal projects of mine that rely heavily on dynamic data that changes alot.</p>

		<h5>Challenge Problems</h5>
		<p>Challenge problems were the topic of the day. We had a few using multidimensional arrays were we needed to print specific indexs from those array in a special order. As the arrays were multidimensional we needed multiple indexes to access the things we needed to print out. After this I worked on recoding some PHP for one of my personal websites. I am using MySQL to store data and I am using an object oriented approach to how I handle it. This will take a bit to get all the parts to work together, but it will make adding changes and getting data logs much easier with this sort of structure.</p>

		<h5>Challenge Problems</h5>
		<p>Today we had a few labs to work on. They dealt with JavaScript functions and form handling. After those we moved into using jQuery in the same labs to see the differences between. Next we did form validation with using jQuery and auto updating when values are entered. The auto updating was calculation ideal values based on one of the entered field. I started on a personal project then which at first will be a WPM calculator, then will evolve into being collaborative programming. This is pose many problems that will need to be solved and should be alot of fun.</p>
